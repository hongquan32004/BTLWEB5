            <h4>4. INTERNATIONAL AND GROUP COMPANY TRANSFERS</h4>
            <p>Nexlab Technology has clients from across continents. Therefore, we may from time to time disclose your personal data within our clients. Some of our clients are located outside the European Union (“EU”) or European Economic Area (“EEA”), but we implement and maintain policies designed to ensure the security of such disclosures and transfers in accordance with the applicable privacy and data protection laws.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you reside in the EU or EEA, we will only transfer your personal data outside the EU or EEA where we are satisfied that adequate levels of protection are in place designed to protect the integrity and security of any information being processed in compliance with applicable privacy and data protection laws. These measures may include, as applicable, the use of standard contractual/data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission and where transfers are to the United States of America, the EU-US Privacy Shield, Swiss-US Privacy Shield or your consent. Where we transfer personal data between our group companies we have covered these transfers by entering into standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission.</p>
            <p>You may request further information on the measures used for such transfers via the contact details given in this Privacy Notice.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>5. YOUR CHOICES</h4>
            <p>You have certain choices about how we use your information.</p>
            <p>You may choose not to receive marketing communications from us. You can ask us to stop such messages at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the message.  Please note that even if you choose not to receive marketing communications from us, you still may receive non-marketing communications, such as responses to your inquiries or notices regarding your account or our relationship with you</p>
            <br>
            <h4>6. YOUR EU/EEA RIGHTS</h4>
            <p>Under EU data protection law we are required to advise you on the legal basis for processing your personal data. For the most part, the processing of your personal information is based either on a) our legitimate interests related to us providing you services you have requested or otherwise your customer relationship with us, or b) your consent, where requested.</p>
            <p>Where provided under applicable law, you may have the following rights:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Object to our processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on legitimate interest (or those of a third-party), and you want to object to processing on this ground, as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have a right to object where we are processing your personal data for the purposes of direct marketing or profiling. You can object at any time and we shall stop processing the information you have objected to, unless we can show compelling legitimate grounds to continue that processing.</li>
                <li><strong>Access your personal data.</strong> If you make this kind of request and we hold personal data about you. We are required to provide you with information on it, including a description and copy of the personal data and why we are processing it. We will require you to prove your identity before granting access to your personal data. We will process your request within the timeframe required under the relevant law.</li>
                <li><strong>Request the transfer of your personal data.</strong> We will provide to you or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Please note, this right applies to the personal data you have provided to us; and if we use your personal data on the basis of consent or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
                <li><strong>Request erasure (deletion) of your personal data.</strong> You have a right to ask us to delete or remove your data where you have successfully exercised your right to object (see above), or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Please note, we may be required to retain certain information by law and/or for our own legitimate business purpose. But when we do so, we will inform you</li>
                <li><strong>Request correction or updating of your personal data.</strong> This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected.</li>
                <li><strong>Request the restriction of our processing</strong> of your personal data in some situations. If you request this, we can continue to store your personal data but are restricted from processing it while the restriction is in place.</li>
                <li><strong>Withdraw your consent.</strong> Where you have provided your consent to our processing of your personal data you can withdraw your consent at any time. If you do withdraw consent, that will not affect the lawfulness of what we have done with your personal data before you withdrew consent.</li>
                <li><strong>Make a Complaint.</strong> We will do our best to resolve any complaint. However, if you feel we have not resolved your complaint, you have a right to make a complaint to your local data protection authority. For example, in the UK, the local data protection authority is the UK Information Commissioner's Office.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you exercise the rights above and there is any question about who you are, we may require you to provide information from which we can satisfy ourselves as to your identity.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>7. YOUR CALIFORNIA RIGHTS</h4>
            <p>This section describes the rights that residents of California have and in other jurisdiction as provided by local law, and how to exercise such rights.</p>
            <br>
            <h6>   1. Right to Know about Personal Information Collected, Disclosed or Sold</h6>
            <p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection, use, disclosure or sale of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see <i>Exercising Access and Deletion Rights</i>), and subject to certain limitations that we describe below, we will disclose such information. You have the right to request any or all of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
                <li>The categories of sources from which the personal information is collected.</li>
                <li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.</li>
                <li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>
                <li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>  2. Right to Request Deletion</h6>
            <p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see <i>Exercising Access and Deletion Rights</i>), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records.  However, we may retain personal information that has been de-identified or aggregated. Furthermore, we may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) in order to perform certain actions set forth under CCPA, such as detecting security incidents and protecting against fraudulent or illegal activity.</p>
            <br>
            <h6>   3. Exercising Access and Deletion Rights</h6>
            <p>Only you, or a person or business entity registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf (an “authorized agent”), may make the requests set forth above. You may also make a request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The request should include your contact information and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. In addition, you should provide sufficient information (including information that reasonably enables us verify the identifying information we currently maintain about you) that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected the personal information or an authorized representative.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We will respond to consumer requests in a reasonably timely manner. If we require extra time to respond, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. In order to protect the security of your personal information, we will not honor a request if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. The method used to verify your identity will depend on the type, sensitivity and value of the information, including the risk of harm to you posed by any authorized access or deletion. Generally speaking, verification will be performed by matching the identifying information provided by you to the personal information that we already have.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request (and will not be made more than twice in a 12-month period). If we cannot comply with a request, or cannot fully comply with a request, the response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply.</p>
            <br>
            <h6>  4. Non-Discrimination</h6>
            <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights, including, but not limited to, by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Denying you goods or services.</li>
                <li>Charging you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>
                <li>Providing you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
                <li>Suggesting that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
            </ul>
